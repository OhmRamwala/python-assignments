## Task 1: Even or Odd Number Check

This task involves checking whether a given number is even or odd.

- I used basic arithmetic and applied the **modulus (`%`) operator** to check if the number is divisible by 2.
- If the number is completely divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`), it is considered an **even number**.
- Otherwise, it is an **odd number**.

The logic is implemented using a simple **if-else statement**.

## Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

In this task, the goal was to calculate the sum of all numbers from **1 to 50**.

- I used a **`for` loop** with the **`range()` function** to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
- During each iteration, the current number was added to a total using the **`+=` assignment operator**.
- Finally, the total sum was printed.
