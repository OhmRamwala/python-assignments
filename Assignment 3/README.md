## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

I created a simple Python program to calculate the factorial of a number using basic logic (a loop-based approach). Later, I discovered that the `math` module provides an inbuilt `factorial()` function that can simplify this task significantly.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

I explored the Python `math` module online and experimented with various functions. Using `print()`, I displayed the outputs of functions like `sqrt()`, `log()`, and `sin()` to understand how they work and how to use them in calculations.
