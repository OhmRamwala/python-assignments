## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

I created a dictionary with a few students' names as keys and their marks as values.  
Then, I asked the user to enter a student's name and displayed their marks accordingly.  
To handle the case where the entered name does not exist in the dictionary, I used a `try-except` block and addressed the `KeyError` with a user-friendly message.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

I created a list of numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.  
Then, I demonstrated Python's slicing feature by:
- Printing the first 5 elements of the list.
- Printing the entire list in reverse order using slicing.
