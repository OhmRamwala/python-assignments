# Task 1

It was an easy task. I took input from users and wrote the print statements with direct equations, but I encountered an error related to string operations.  
Then I remembered that the `input()` function takes input and stores it as a string, and we can't do arithmetic operations on strings.  
So, I used the `int()` function to convert those inputs and completed the task.

# Task 2

It was a simple print statement task and concatenation of strings.  
I took user inputs, created another variable that performed the concatenation, and then used a print statement to display the final output.
